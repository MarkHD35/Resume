# Resume
Here I'll try to keep an updated copy of my resume along with the TeX files used to create it.  As a learning experience, I am trying to create them from scratch instead of relying on a template as I have done previously.  In so doing I have referred to a tutorial from http://texblog.org/2012/04/25/writing-a-cv-in-latex/, which I would like to credit here.
