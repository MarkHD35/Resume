\section*{Experience}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
Summer 2015 & {\textbf{Software Engineer Intern}, \emph{Algorithmia}, Seattle, WA, USA}. 
\newline Researched and implemented state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and applications.  These include a face recognition system using OpenCV and local binary pattern histograms as well as a word2vec-based distance metric for documents particularly geared to improving recommendation accuracy on corpora whose texts have fewer directly overlapping words.  
\\

2014-2015 & {\textbf{Teaching Assistant}, \emph{Washington University in St. Louis}, St. Louis, MO, USA}. 
\newline Held office hours and lab sessions, graded, and answered students' questions for Introduction to Machine Learning (CSE 417A), Multi-Agent Systems (CSE 516A), and Fair Division in Theory and Practice (CSE/Pol Sci 245A).  
\\

Summer 2014 & {\textbf{Research Assistant}, \emph{Harvey Mudd College}, Claremont, CA, USA}.
\newline
Used techniques from machine learning and formal language theory to improve computer generation of original jazz solos.  Wrote up contributions as a Java implementation for Impro-Visor, an open-source software program for jazz improvisation, and a working paper, as well as a poster presented with the rest of the Impro-Visor team.  NSF REU program.\\

Summer 2013 & {\textbf{Research Assistant}, \emph{University of North Carolina at Greensboro}, Greensboro, NC, USA}. 
\newline
Proved previous conjectures and new results about subword complexity of partial words, a problem studied in mathematics and computer science with applications to fields such as computational biology.  Wrote up results in a working paper.  NSF REU Program.
\\

Summer 2012 & {\textbf{Student Intern}, \emph{Washington University School of Medicine}, St. Louis, MO, USA}.
\newline
Studied biostatistics at the interdisciplinary graduate level through the NHLBI's SIBS program and used R to apply these methods to biomedical datasets as part of an accompanying practicum.
